This directory contains Lush demos that can be invoked 
directly from the shell command line.

Demos that accept arguments or options will display a short help 
message with a list of options when invoked with the "-h" or "--help" 
options.

The actual code for many of those demos reside in the
"demos" subdirectories withing the various library directories
in $LUSHDIR/lsh and $LUSHDIR/packages
