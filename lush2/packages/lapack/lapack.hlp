#? *** LAPACK
This is the Lush interface to LAPACK the routines. The interface
consists of two parts. The first part (in namesspace <lapack->) is 
a more or less direct, yet incomplete wrapping of the LAPACK API. On
top of it is Lush's linear algebra interface (in namespace <mat->).

#? ** Namespace lapack-

#? << lapack/lapack.lsh


#? ** Linear Algebra Operations (Namespace mat-)

#? << lapack/mat.lsh
