kernel.lsh --
  A generic class for representing kernels.
  Shared by all the SVM implementations below.

libsvm.lsh -- 
  Interface with the well known LIBSVM library.
  The libsvm source code is in directory libsvm.
              
svqp.lsh --
  Interface with the rather old SVQP solver.
  This can be useful for computing optima with
  high accuracy.

svqp2svm.lsh --
  A CSVM implemented with the SVQP2 solver.
  This is slighly faster than LIBSVM.

lasvmXXX.lsh --
  (to be replaced by svqp3 some day)
        
        lasvmcache.lsh -- 
           Generic kernel cache layer
        lasvmvector.lsh
           Sparse vector library
        lasvm.lsh
           LASVM algoritm (see JMLR 6(Sep)-1579--1619, 2005)
