This directory contains Lush modules derived from
Neuristique's SN28 neural network simulator.

Paper documentation is available from Orlogia

There are several demos in $LUSHDIR/packages/sn28/examples.

We suggest:

- bptool: define and train a small convolutional ocr network.
- conjgrad: experiment with second order optimization.
- netold/*: check historical neural network models.
