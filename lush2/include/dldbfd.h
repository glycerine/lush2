/* DLD-4.0 -- DYNAMIC LINK/UNLINK EDITOR FOR C
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * 
 *   DLD-4.0 implements the same functionalities than DLD-3.2.3.
 *   Unlike DLD-3.2.3 however, DLD-4.0 does not rely on machine
 *   specific code but makes extensive use of the GNU "BFD" library.
 *   This allows us to easily port DLD on new platforms.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS OF DLD-4.0
 *
 * - Ignore warnings attached to symbols.
 * - Ignore constructor/destructor sections.
 * - Support for indirect symbols is untested.
 * - Weakly defined symbols are partially supported (one way!)
 * - Common symbols are defined in the bss section of the first referencing file
 * - No relaxation is performed ever.
 *
