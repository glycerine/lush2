The best way to browse the Lush manual is to use the Lush GUI 
application "helptool". Helptool can be invoked from the Lush 
prompt by typing (helptool), or can be called from the shell
prompt by running LUSHDIR/etc/lush-manual
(this assumes you have installed the Lush executable in /usr/bin, 
 which should be the case if you typed "make install").

This directory contains HTML and LateX/PS/PDF/DjVu versions of
Lush manual. The content of this directory is generated automatically
from the source form of the Lush manual. The source material is in 
lsh/lush-manual.hlp and in the files it includes.

The HTML manual is accessible from LUSHDIR/doc/html/index.html
The HTML manual can be re-generated from the shell prompt by 
running the script LUSHDIR/etc/make-html-manual
or by starting Lush and typing (libload "help") and (make-html-manual) 
at the Lush prompt (this takes a while and quite a lot of memory).

The LateX/PS/PDF/DjVu manual can be re-generated from the shell 
prompt by running the Lush script LUSHDIR/etc/make-latex-manual
or by starting Lush and typing (libload "help") and (make-latex-manual) 
at the Lush prompt (this takes a while and quite a lot of memory).
