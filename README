README: lush2 sources on github.

*** Notes on 6 April 2012:

To reinstate support for OSX snow leopard and above, I added patches based on apples dyldinfo.cpp source code. The resulting patches are available under the Apple public source license, version 2, viewable in the lush2/APSL2 file and here:

http://www.opensource.apple.com/license/apsl/

To compile successfully on my Snow leopard install, I do:

$ LIBS=-lfontconfig ./configure; make

and then run in place with:

$ bin/lush2
